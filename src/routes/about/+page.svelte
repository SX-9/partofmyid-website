        <h2>What is part-of.my.id?</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="/">part-of.my.id</a> is a personal project by <a href="//satr14.my.id">satr14</a> to provide subdomains for personal websites, open-source projects, and more. Registering a subdomain is easy on the web dashboard. Just choose one and register it. We have support for <code>A</code>, <code>AAAA</code>, <code>CNAME</code>, and <code>TXT</code> records.
        </p>
        <h2>Example use case:</h2>
        <p>
            Say your hosting a portfolio on <a href="https://github.io">GitHub Pages</a> and want to use a custom domain, you can use <a href="/">part-of.my.id</a> to create a subdomain and point it to your GitHub repository rather than buying a domain or using the default <code>github.io</code> domain.
        </p>
        <h2>Report a website</h2>
        <p>
            Everything to manage <a href="/">part-of.my.id</a> is done through the root domain only. Any subdomain is a separate website and is not created by us. If you find a website thats abusing our service or claims to be us, <a href="//github.com/SX-9/part-of-my-id/issues/new">please report it</a>.
